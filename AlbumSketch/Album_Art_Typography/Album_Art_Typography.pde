he'd pull out Bobby stayed in Janey had a baby it wasn't any sin They were set to marry on a summer day Bobby got scared and he ran away Jane moved in with her ma out on Shawnee Lake She sighed Ma sometimes my whole life feels like one big mistake She settled in in a back room time passed on Later that winter a son came along Spare parts And broken hearts Keep the world turnin' around Now Janey walked that baby across the floor night after night But she was a young girl and she missed the party lights Meanwhile in South Texas in a dirty oil patch Bobby heard 'bout his son bein' born and swore he wasn't ever goin' back Spare parts And broken hearts Keep the world turnin' around Janey heard about a woman over in Calverton Put her baby in the river let the river roll on She looked at her boy in the crib where he lay Got down on her knees cried till she prayed Mist was on the water low run the tide Janey held her son down at the riverside Waist deep in water how bright the sun shone She lifted him in her arms and carried him home As he lay sleeping in her bed Janey took a look around at everything Went to a drawer in her bureau and got out her old engagement ring Took out her wedding dress tied that ring up in its sash Went straight down to the pawn shop man and walked out with some good cold cash Spare parts And broken hearts Keep the world turnin' around Bill Horton was a cautious man of the road He walked lookin' over his shoulder and remained faithful to its code When something caught his eye he'd measure his need And then very carefully he'd proceed Billy met a young girl in the early days of May It was there in her arms he let his cautiousness slip away In their lovers twilight as the evening sky grew dim He'd lay back in her arms and laugh at what had happened to him On his right hand Billy tattooed the word love and on his left hand was the word fear And in which hand he held his fate was never clear Come Indian summer he took his young lover for his bride And with his own hands built a great house down by the riverside Now Billy was an honest man he wanted to do what was right He worked hard to fill their lives with happy days and loving nights Alone on his knees in the darkness for steadiness he'd pray For he knew in a restless heart the seed of betrayal lay One night Billy awoke from a terrible dream callin' his wife's name She lay breathing beside him in a peaceful sleep, a thousand miles away He got dressed in the moonlight and down to the highway he strode When he got there he didn't find nothing but road Billy felt a coldness rise up inside him that he couldn't name Just as the words tattooed 'cross his knuckles he knew would always remain At their bedside he brushed the hair from his wife's face as the moon shone on her skin so white Filling their room with the beauty of God's fallen light I remember how rough your hand felt on mine On my wedding day And the tears cried on my shoulder I couldn't turn away Well so much has happened to me That I don't understand All I can think of is being five years old following behind you at the beach Tracing your footprints in the sand Trying to walk like a man By Our Lady Of The Roses We lived in the shadow of the elms I remember ma draggin' me and my sister up the street to the church Whenever she heard those wedding bells Well would they ever look so happy again The handsome groom and his bride As they stepped into that long black limousine For their mystery ride Well tonight you step away from me And alone at the alter I stand And as I watch my bride coming down the aisle I pray For the strength to walk like a man Well now the years have gone and I've grown From that seed you've sown But I didn't think there'd be so many steps I'd have to learn on my own Well I was young and I didn't know what to do When I saw your best steps stolen away from you Now I'll do what I can I'll walk like a man And I'll keep on walkin' Fat man sitting on a little stool Takes the money from my hand while his eyes take a walk all over you Hands me the ticket smiles and whispers good luck Cuddle up angel cuddle up my little dove We'll ride down baby into this tunnel of love I can feel the soft silk of your blouse And them soft thrills in our little fun house Then the lights go out and it's just the three of us You me and all that stuff we're so scared of Gotta ride down baby into this tunnel of love There's a crazy mirror showing us both in 5-D I'm laughing at you you're laughing at me There's a room of shadows that gets so dark brother It's easy for two people to lose each other in this tunnel of love it ought to be easy ought to be simple enough Man meets woman and they fall in love But the house is haunted and the ride gets rough And you've got to learn to live with what you can't rise above if you want to ride on down in through this tunnel of love I met a girl and we ran away I swore I'd make her happy every day And how I made her cry Two faces have I Sometimes mister I feel sunny and wild Lord I love to see my baby smile Then dark clouds come rolling by Two faces have I One that laughs one that cries One says hello one says goodbye One does things I don't understand Makes me feel like half a man At night I get down on my knees and pray Our love will make that other man go away But he'll never say goodbye Two faces have I Last night as I kissed you 'neath the willow tree He swore he'd take your love away from me He said our life was just a lie And two faces have I Well go ahead and let him try I hold you in my arms as the band plays What are those words whispered baby just as you turn away I saw you last night out on the edge of town I wanna read your mind To know just what I've got in this new thing I've found So tell me what I see when I look in your eyes Is that you baby or just a brilliant disguise I heard somebody call your name from underneath our willow I saw something tucked in shame underneath your pillow Well I've tried so hard baby but I just can't see What a woman like you is doing with me So tell me who I see when I look in your eyes Is that you baby or just a brilliant disguise Now look at me baby struggling to do everything right And then it all falls apart when out go the lights I'm just a lonely pilgrim I walk this world in wealth I want to know if it's you I don't trust 'cause I damn sure don't trust myself Now you play the loving woman I'll play the faithful man But just don't look too close into the palm of my hand We stood at the alter the gypsy swore our future was right But come the wee wee hours Well maybe baby the gypsy lied So when you look at me you better look hard and look twice Is that me baby or just a brilliant disguise Tonight our bed is cold I'm lost in the darkness of our love God have mercy on the man Who doubts what he's sure of Woke up this morning my house was cold Checked out the furnace she wasn't burnin' Went out and hopped in my old Ford Hit the engine but she ain't turnin' We've given each other some hard lessons lately But we ain't learnin' We're the same sad story that's a fact One step up and two steps back Bird on a wire outside my motel room But he ain't singin' Girl in white outside a church in June But the church bells they ain't ringing I'm sittin' here in this bar tonight But all I'm thinkin' is I'm the same old story same old act One step up and two steps back It's the same thing night on night Who's wrong baby who's right Another fight and I slam the door on Another battle in our dirty little war When I look at myself I don't see The man I wanted to be Somewhere along the line I slipped off track I'm caught movin' one step up and two steps back There's a girl across the bar I get the message she's sendin' Mmm she ain't lookin' to married And me well honey I'm pretending Last night I dreamed I held you in my arms The music was never-ending We danced as the evening sky faded to black One step up and two steps back Times were tough love was not enough So you said sorry Johnny I'm gone gone gone You said my act was funny But we both knew what was missing honey So you let out on your own Now that pretty form that you've got baby Will make sure you get along But you're gonna find out someday honey When you're alone you're alone When you're alone you're alone When you're alone you're alone When you're alone you ain't nothing but alone Now I was young and pretty on the mean streets of the city And I fought to make 'em my home With just the shirt on my back I left and swore I'd never look back And man I was gone gone gone But there's things that'll knock you down you don't even see coming And send you crawling like a baby back home You're gonna find out that day sugar When you're alone you're alone When you're alone you're aloneWhen you're alone you're alone When you're alone you ain't nothing but alone I knew some day your runnin' would be through And you'd think back on me and you And your love would be strong You'd forget all the bad and think only of all the laughs that we had And you'd wanna come home Now it ain't hard feelings or nothin' sugar That ain't what's got me singing this song It's just nobody knows baby where love goes But when it goes it's gone gone When you're alone you're alone When you're alone you're aloneWhen you're alone you're alone When you're alone you ain't nothing but alone I'm driving a big lazy car rushin' up the highway in the dark I got one hand steady on the wheel and one hand's tremblin' over my heart It's pounding baby like it's gonna bust right on through And it ain't gonna stop till I'm alone again with you A friend of mine became a father last night When we spoke in his voice I could hear the light Of the skies and the rivers the timberwolf in the pines And that great jukebox out on Route 39 They say he travels fastest who travels alone But tonight I miss my girl mister tonight I miss my home Is it the sound of the leaves left blown by the wayside That's got me out here on this spooky old highway tonight Is it the cry of the river With the moonlight shining through That ain't what scares me baby What scares me is losing you They say if you die in your dreams you really die in your bed But honey last night I dreamed my eyes rolled straight back in my head And God's light came shinin' on through I woke up in the darkness scared and breathin' and born anew It wasn't the cold river bottom I felt rushing over me It wasn't the bitterness of a dream that didn't come true It wasn't the wind in the grey fields I felt rushing through my arms No no baby it was you So hold me close honey say you're forever mine And tell me you'll be my lonely valentine";
